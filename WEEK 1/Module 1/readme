WEEK 1 MODULE 1 VIDEO WISE EXPLAINATION OF TASK
USE OF GROQ AI AND GROQ EMBEDDINGS INSTEAD OF OPEN AI AND OPEN AI EMBEDDINGS
USED THE MODEL openai/gpt-oss-120b FOR MOST TASKS

LESSON 1 TRACING BASICS - The @traceable decorator in LangSmith makes it easy to track function calls. It builds a clear “run tree” so you can see how your app runs, check performance, and organize everything with metadata.

LESSON 2 TYPES OF RUNS - The video shows how to use observability in LangChain with LangSmith. It explains the different run types (LLM, retriever, tool), how to trace and log them, and how to view results in LangSmith. It also covers streaming outputs, adding metadata to track models, and using the LangSmith playground to debug and improve AI workflows.

LESSON 3 DIFFERENT WAYS TO TRACE - The video explains different ways to add tracing in LangChain apps. It highlights the @traceable decorator for automatic run trees, and also shows other options like using environment variables, context managers, or wrapping OpenAI SDK calls to make debugging and observability easier with LangSmith.
